# Problem 1: Find Closest NFT Values

# Understand:
# - We need to find the two NFT values closest to a given budget.
# - The function should work with any list of NFT values and any budget.

# Match:
# - This problem can be solved using a max heap to keep track of the two closest values.

# Plan:
# 1. Create a max heap to store the two closest values.
# 2. Iterate through the NFT values, calculating the difference from the budget.
# 3. Push each value onto the heap, keeping only the two closest.
# 4. Return the two closest values.

# Implement:
def find_closest_nft_values(nft_values, budget):
    import heapq
    maxheap = []
    for num in nft_values:
        heapq.heappush(maxheap, ((-1 * abs(budget-num)), num ))
        if len(maxheap) > 2:
            heapq.heappop(maxheap)
    
    return [n[1] for n in maxheap]

# Review:
# - The function correctly finds the two closest NFT values to the given budget.
# - It uses a max heap to efficiently keep track of the two closest values.

# Evaluate:
# Time complexity: O(n log 2) â‰ˆ O(n), where n is the number of NFT values.
# Space complexity: O(1), as we only keep a max heap of at most 2 elements.

# Test cases
nft_values = [3.5, 5.4, 7.2, 9.0, 10.5]
nft_values_2 = [2.0, 4.5, 6.3, 7.8, 12.1]

# Problem 2: Find Trending Meme

# Understand:
# - We need to find the meme with the highest total reposts within a given time range.
# - The time range is inclusive of both start and end days.

# Match:
# - This problem can be solved by iterating through the memes and summing their reposts.

# Plan:
# 1. Initialize variables to keep track of the highest repost count and corresponding meme name.
# 2. Iterate through each meme.
# 3. Sum the reposts for the given time range.
# 4. Update the highest count and meme name if necessary.
# 5. Return the name of the trending meme.

# Implement:
def find_trending_meme(memes, start_day, end_day):
    res = 0
    w = ""
    for meme in memes:
        name = meme['name']
        count = 0

        if count > res:
            w = meme["name"]
            res = count
    return w

# Review:
# - The function correctly finds the meme with the highest total reposts within the given range.
# - It handles multiple memes and different time ranges.

# Evaluate:
# Time complexity: O(m * n), where m is the number of memes and n is the range of days (end_day - start_day + 1).
# Space complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space.

# Test cases
memes = [

# Problem 3: Organize Fabric Rolls

# Understand:
# - We need to pair up fabric rolls, starting with the smallest.
# - If there's an odd number of rolls, the largest one is left unpaired.

# Match:
# - This problem can be solved by sorting the rolls and then pairing them.

# Plan:
# 1. Sort the fabric rolls in ascending order.
# 2. Iterate through the sorted list, pairing the first two rolls each time.
# 3. If there's an odd number of rolls, add the last one separately.

# Implement:
def organize_fabric_rolls(fabric_rolls):
    fabric_rolls.sort()  # Sort the fabric rolls by length
    pairs = []

    while len(fabric_rolls) > 1:
        smallest = fabric_rolls.pop(0)

# Review:
# - The function correctly pairs up the fabric rolls, starting with the smallest.
# - It handles both even and odd numbers of rolls.

# Evaluate:

# Problem 4: Find Best Break Pair

# Understand:
# - We need to find a pair of break times that sum up closest to the target time.
# - If multiple pairs have the same difference, return the pair with the smaller break times.

# Match:
# - This problem can be solved using the two-pointer technique on a sorted array.

# Plan:
# 1. Sort the break times.
# 2. Use two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the sorted array.
# 3. Move the pointers based on the sum comparison with the target.
# 4. Keep track of the closest pair found.

# Implement:
def find_best_break_pair(break_times, target):

# Plan:
# 1. Create a hash map to store the count of visits for each city.

# Problem 6: Find Longest Gap

# Understand:
# - We need to find the longest time gap between consecutive timestamps.
# - Timestamps are given as integers.

# Match:
# - This problem can be solved by iterating through the sorted timestamps and calculating the differences.

# Plan:
# 1. Initialize the result to 0.
# 2. Iterate through the timestamps from index 0 to second-to-last.

# Problem 7: Analyze Storyline Continuity

# Understand:
# - We need to check if the scenes in a storyline are in chronological order.
# - Each scene has a timestamp, and we need to ensure they're in ascending order.

# Match:
# - This problem can be solved by comparing consecutive timestamps.

# Plan:
# 1. Iterate through the scenes starting from the second scene.
# 2. Compare each scene's timestamp with the previous scene's timestamp.
# 3. If any timestamp is less than or equal to the previous one, return False.

# Problem 8: Check Expiration Order

# Understand:
# - We need to check if a list of items with expiration dates is in order.
# - Dates are given in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
# - The function should return True if the dates are in ascending order, False otherwise.

# Match:
# - This problem can be solved by comparing consecutive dates.
# - We can use a stack to keep track of the dates and compare each new date with the last one on the stack.

# Plan:
# 1. Initialize an empty stack to store processed dates.
# 2. Iterate through the expiration dates:
#    a. Split each date into year, month, and day.
#    b. Convert year, month, and day to integers for comparison.
#    c. If the stack is empty, push the current date onto it.
#    d. Otherwise, compare the current date with the last date on the stack:
#       - If the current date is earlier, return False.
#       - If not, push the current date onto the stack.
# 3. If we've processed all dates without returning False, return True.

# Implement:

# Review:
# - The function correctly checks if the expiration dates are in ascending order.
# - It handles the comparison of years, months, and days separately.
# - The use of a stack allows for efficient comparison with the previous date.
# - The function returns False as soon as it finds a date out of order, which is efficient.

# Evaluate:
# Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of expiration dates. We iterate through the list once.
# Space complexity: O(n) in the worst case, where all dates are in order and we store them all in the stack.
